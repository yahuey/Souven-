# 02 Ponder : Weekly Reflection

1. Describe one challenge your team experienced working on the Vacation Calendar activity.
Working and using the ENUM type. 


2. For the Game of Life assignment, what advantages do you see in using interfaces to define creature behaviors, rather than subclasses?
It allows for unrelated items with similar character


3. Did you complete the Stretch Challenge for the Game of Life Assignment? If so, briefly describe what you did, and how you structured your code.
N/a

4. What did you learn from comparing your code to the teacher's solution?
My modularity could improve.


5. After completing the assignments this week, what questions do you still have?
Non I can think of. 


6. If you were getting paid to work on this week's Prove assignment and you had another month to work on it, what would you add?
Make it more random, like life. Attacks don't land. I would have placed an evolve feature for animals that survive encounters. 


7. A common Java interview question is "describe the difference between an interface and an abstract class". How would you answer that question?
An abstract class would not be able to offer the same flexibility of an interface due to you being able to only inherit one class. An abstract will limit you greatly. 



8. Of all of the resources in this week's Preparation assignment, which was the _most_ helpful to you and why?
The documentation on Java was key to success.

9. Of all of the resources in this week's Preparation assignment, which was the _least_ helpful to you and why?
